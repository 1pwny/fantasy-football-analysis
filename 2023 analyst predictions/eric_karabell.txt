1. Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs (QB1): Coming off his first season leading all QBs in fantasy scoring since 2018, but he is also the safest pick.

2. Josh Allen, Bills (QB2): A bit more upside with Allen, because he runs for more yards and scores, and largely safe, too.

3. Jalen Hurts, Eagles (QB3): He led the league with 25.2 PPR points per game. If you want to take him No. 1, go for it.

4. Joe Burrow, Bengals (QB4): Perhaps a tier below the Big Three QBs, but he's also ahead of the next tier, at 21.9 points per game.

5. Lamar Jackson, Ravens (QB5): A bit of drama with him this offseason, but still a remarkable talent.

6. Justin Fields, Bears (QB6): Passing skills should improve as team upgrades his options.

7. Justin Herbert, Chargers (QB7): Fantastic talent, and wide receiver group has been upgraded.

8. Justin Jefferson, Vikings (WR1): Led league in receptions and receiving yards. Gets the nod as first WR off the board here.

9. Ja'Marr Chase, Bengals (WR2): Bengals offense should be terrific for a long time.

10. Cooper Kupp, Rams (WR3): Don't expect 2021 statistics again, but he can still dominate, and should return to full health after ankle surgery.

11. Trevor Lawrence, Jaguars (QB8)

12. Kirk Cousins, Vikings (QB9)

13. Aaron Rodgers, Jets (QB10): Sure seems likely his rough 2022 season was aberrant, and he is unlikely to disappoint again.

14. Austin Ekeler, Chargers (RB1): Scored 38 touchdowns the past two seasons. There's nobody like him.

15. Christian McCaffrey, 49ers (RB2): Credit where it's due: He played in all 17 games, and played awesome.

16. Tyreek Hill, Dolphins (WR4): Just needs his quarterback to stay on the field.

17. Travis Kelce, Chiefs (TE1): Was outscored by only seven non-QBs in fantasy points. Yeah, he's that much better than every other TE.

18. Davante Adams, Raiders (WR5): Fantastic player and it probably does not matter who plays QB.

19. Stefon Diggs, Bills (WR6): Nothing wrong with his numbers last season.

20. Dak Prescott, Cowboys (QB11)

21. Deshaun Watson, Browns (QB12)

22. CeeDee Lamb, Cowboys (WR7)

23. Amon-Ra St. Brown, Lions (WR8)

24. A.J. Brown, Eagles (WR9)

25. Garrett Wilson, Jets (WR10): Last year's top rookie gets a top quarterback, and the numbers should get even better.

26. Derrick Henry, Titans (RB3): It wasn't a 2,000-yard season, but still very good, and he caught a career-best 33 passes.

27. Saquon Barkley, Giants (RB4): Reception total may never match rookie total, but everthing else was great.

28. Bijan Robinson, Falcons (RB5): Fantastic college running back just needs volume with his new franchise.

29. Geno Smith, Seahawks (QB13): No. 5 QB from last season will come at a discount, but it shouldn't be too much of one.

30. Daniel Jones, Giants (QB14): The team reinvested in him, and perhaps that should tell us something.

31. Tua Tagovailoa, Dolphins (QB15)

32. Russell Wilson, Broncos (QB16): He gets a new chance with a new coach, and things have to improve.

33. Anthony Richardson, Colts (QB17): Dynamic upside, but rookies are dangerous. Make sure he's not your first QB.

34. Jaylen Waddle, Dolphins (WR11)

35. DeVonta Smith, Eagles (WR12): Philly offense can support multiple top wide receivers again.

36. Tee Higgins, Bengals (WR13)

37. DK Metcalf, Seahawks (WR14): Wonderful talent and the QB play was excellent.

38. Chris Olave, Saints (WR15): New QB, but this one should be an upgrade.

39. Jared Goff, Lions (QB18): The guy below won a Super Bowl, but which QB do you want this fall? A case can be made either way.

40. Matthew Stafford, Rams (QB19): Can't expect his 2021 stats again, but can expect health and fantasy-relevance.

41. Kenny Pickett, Steelers (QB20)

42. Nick Chubb, Browns (RB6): That makes four consecutive top-10 finishes at RB, even though he isn't catching many passes.

43. Tony Pollard, Cowboys (RB7): Eighth among RBs in PPR points, despite being 23rd in rushing attempts. Yeah, he's that good.

44. Jordan Love, Packers (QB21): It's time to find out if he can play. We bet he can.

45. Derek Carr, Saints (QB22): He gets a new chance in another city and he should play competently again.

46. Bryce Young, Panthers (QB23): Not the runner that Richardson is, but a tremendous talent.

47. Kyler Murray, Cardinals (QB24): Ranked this low due to concern about his knee surgery costing him September games.

48. Jimmy Garoppolo, Raiders (QB25): Competent passer who gets to throw to a great wide receiver, which helps.

49. Travis Etienne Jr., Jaguars (RB8): The breakout season we expected, even though he caught no more than three passes in any game.

50. Josh Jacobs, Raiders (RB9)

51. Joe Mixon, Bengals (RB10)

52. Aaron Jones, Packers (RB11): Averaged 5.3 yards per rush, but needs more touches.

53. Rhamondre Stevenson, Patriots (RB12): Backfield is more crowded than originally expected.

54. Najee Harris, Steelers (RB13): Foot injury compromised him, mainly in the passing game, but don't forget how much volume he had as a rookie.

55. Ryan Tannehill, Titans (QB26): Still starting, for now, so perhaps he can rediscover his 2020 and 2021 seasons.

56. Brock Purdy, 49ers (QB27)

57. Diontae Johnson, Steelers (WR16): Johnson scored the same number of TDs as you did this season! Hard to believe, but it will not continue.

58. Mac Jones, Patriots (QB28): Not a good season, but even the QBs we ignore offer value in superflex formats.

59. Keenan Allen, Chargers (WR17)

60. Deebo Samuel, 49ers (WR18): Stats were not as expected, and it is fair to question his durability now.

61. Amari Cooper, Browns (WR19)

62. Chris Godwin, Buccaneers (WR20)

63. Drake London, Falcons (WR21)

64. Jahmyr Gibbs, Lions (RB14): Swift trade opens up more opportunity, especially in the passing game.

65. Kenneth Walker III, Seahawks (RB15)

66. C.J. Stroud, Texans (QB29): Sure looks like he had better options to throw to in college.

67. Sam Howell, Commanders (QB30)

68. Desmond Ridder, Falcons (QB31)

69. Baker Mayfield, Buccaneers (QB32)

70. Calvin Ridley, Jaguars (WR22): Returns to the NFL after considerable time away, presumably with the skills we remember.

71. T.J. Hockenson, Vikings (TE2)

72. Mark Andrews, Ravens (TE3): Uneven season for the preseason No. 2 TE, but let's remember his fantastic 2021 campaign.

73. James Conner, Cardinals (RB16): Played well in second half of the season and could return to RB1 status with loads of TDs.

74. Dameon Pierce, Texans (RB17)

75. Alexander Mattison, Vikings (RB18)

76. Rachaad White, Buccaneers (RB19)

77. Christian Watson, Packers (WR23)

78. DeAndre Hopkins, Titans (WR24):
